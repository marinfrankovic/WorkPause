# WorkPause verification

## WorkPause 1.0.3 Preview: unlock reminders

The release uses version name **1.0.3**, version code **5**, and the existing
release-signing identity. The GitHub release title retains **Preview** and is marked
Latest for visibility. It updates over 1.0.2 and the local 1.0.3-preview build without
uninstalling or clearing app data.

The new reminder policy tests cover disabled schedules, ended work hours, removed
profiles, absence of a resume request, waiting for the phone to unlock, resumed but
credential-storage-locked profiles, still-paused profiles, unknown state, and the
distinction between unlocked storage and a separate work-app credential challenge.
An already running, storage-unlocked profile does not create a new reminder.

Notifications use a separate high-importance channel, an immutable explicit activity
PendingIntent, and a non-exported work-app picker. No hidden credential API, PIN
collection, full-screen intent, or lock-screen wake is added. Public `LauncherApps`
launches the user-selected work app so Android can enforce its work challenge.
`UserManager.isUserUnlocked(profile)` reports credential-storage state, not every
possible separate challenge state; notification wording reflects that limitation.
On Android 11+, the credential-not-required flag is used for all scheduled resume
attempts, including while the phone is unlocked. A foreground, user-initiated action
uses the prompting overload. This avoids recurring system PIN popups on automatic
retries after cancellation. Android 10 retains its existing older API behavior.

Android sends `MANAGED_PROFILE_UNLOCKED` only to runtime-registered receivers. The
application registers a non-exported receiver for the lifetime of its process;
no background service is added. If Android stops that process before a work-app
unlock outside WorkPause, immediate reminder cleanup cannot be guaranteed.

### Local validation

The managed-profile runtime checks below were performed on the signed
**1.0.3-preview (code 4)** candidate. The **1.0.3 (code 5)** release retains that
implementation, updates the version and setup/help wording, and has its own build,
test, lint, package, and signature checks. They are not Samsung functional tests.

- **43 unit tests passed:** 24 weekly-schedule, 7 location, and 12 reminder-policy tests.
- Debug lint passed with 12 warnings and 1 informational finding; the new profile
  reminder classes have no lint findings. The signed, optimized release build passed.
- An isolated Android 15 / API 35 emulator used a disposable managed profile and
  work PIN. Updating over 1.0.2 retained saved app state and the silent-control grant.
- Saving today's OFF/ON rules exercised real schedule reconciliation: an actionable,
  high-importance reminder appeared without an automatic credential popup.
- Tapping the reminder opened Android Settings' work-PIN UI. Canceling returned to
  the work-app picker, retained the reminder, and did not immediately prompt again.
  Explicit retry reopened Android's credential UI; successful PIN entry cleared the
  reminder through the runtime profile-unlock receiver.
- Returning to the main screen after unlock did not mark an already-running profile
  as a deferred resume; a no-op quiet-mode request is not a credential failure.
- The public `LauncherApps` route opened the selected Files app in managed user 10.
- Turning WorkPause OFF cleared an active reminder without changing the managed
  profile's state. No WorkPause crash was found in the emulator crash buffer.
- The reminder has its own explicit notification group so Android does not replace
  its tap action with the main-screen action of an auto-grouped status summary.

These checks do not establish Samsung heads-up behavior, delivery of an actual
future timed alarm, or every locked-phone, location, and employer-policy scenario.

The release APK is non-debuggable. Its application ID remains
`io.github.marinfrankovic.workpause`; the work-app picker is non-exported. The release
certificate SHA-256 remains:

For the published APK checksum, use
[`SHA256SUMS.txt`](https://github.com/marinfrankovic/WorkPause/releases/download/v1.0.3/SHA256SUMS.txt)
from the matching release. The earlier **local 1.0.3-preview (code 4)** APK has SHA-256
below; it is not the checksum of the version-code-5 release:

```

### Required Samsung acceptance test

1. Update over 1.0.2 without uninstalling. Confirm saved rules and the silent-control
   grant are retained. Allow notifications under Settings > Unlock reminders and
   check Samsung's banner settings for the reminder channel.
2. Keep the phone unlocked with a personal app open. Schedule pause, then resume a
   few minutes later. Confirm a reminder appears in the notification shade, without
   manually opening a work app first. A heads-up banner depends on Android settings.
3. Tap Open work apps and select a work app. Verify that **Android**, not WorkPause,
   asks for the required work PIN and opens the selected app after successful entry.
4. Cancel PIN entry and confirm work apps remain protected and the reminder/picker
   can be used again. If Android reports a profile unlock, the reminder is cleared;
   this OEM-specific behavior needs observation.
5. Repeat with an already unlocked work profile; do not expect an unnecessary new
   reminder when no pause/resume transition occurred.
6. Confirm OFF and the next scheduled pause clear the reminder. A previously opened
   picker must not resume work apps after WorkPause is OFF or outside work hours.
7. Disable notifications and verify the app shows the blocked reminder status while
   scheduling still works. Do Not Disturb may suppress only the heads-up banner.

### Galaxy S24 Ultra: preview update installed

On **2026-10-20**, the signed **1.0.3-preview (code 4)** candidate was installed over
1.0.2 on the personal side of the owner's **Galaxy S24 Ultra (SM-S928B)**.
Installation returned success and foreground launch returned `Status: ok`.
`MODIFY_QUIET_MODE` and `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` remained granted. The APK matched its
recorded checksum; no uninstall or app-data reset was used.

This confirms installation and retained permissions, not notification arrival,
Samsung heads-up settings, or the new credential flow. No schedules were changed
and no manual pause/resume test was initiated on the phone during deployment.
**Notification setup remains necessary:** allow Unlock reminders in WorkPause and
review the dedicated channel's banner/pop-up settings in Android. An allowed runtime
permission does not prove those Samsung settings are enabled.

The existing owner-confirmed functional results below apply to **1.0.2**, not the
new notification or picker behavior.

## CI environment

The Android build workflow uses JDK 17 and explicitly installs `platform-tools` and
`platforms;android-35`. This overrides the pinned SDK setup action's default package
list, which includes the obsolete `tools` package and fails during SDK setup.
The workflow builds the debug APK, runs unit tests and lint, and uploads a debug
artifact; it does not publish or replace the signed release APK.

## Physical phone: user-confirmed operation

On **2026-10-16**, the owner reported personally testing WorkPause 1.0.2 on a
**Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra running One UI 9**, and confirmed that it
**works as expected**.

The owner also reported needing to enter the **work-profile PIN when the profile
turns back on**. This is an expected Android or employer-policy credential
requirement. Silent control requests a profile state change; it does not unlock
the profile or bypass its PIN.

This is a user-confirmed functional result, not an independently observed test or
a general Samsung compatibility certification. Individual test scenarios were not
recorded, so the report does not separately establish scheduled alarm delivery,
other locked-device or credential scenarios, accessibility fallback behavior, or
enterprise-policy compatibility.

### Installation and readiness checks

On **2026-10-16**, WorkPause 1.0.2 (code 3) was installed on the personal side of a
**Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra (SM-S928B)**. The phone reported Android SDK **37**.
The One UI version was supplied by the owner, not independently checked.

| Phone check | Result |
|---|---|
| Published APK checksum | Matched the verified 1.0.2 release asset |
| Installation and foreground launch | Passed |
| Existing managed work profile | Detected by Android and by WorkPause |
| Silent-control permission | `MODIFY_QUIET_MODE` granted to the personal-side app |
| App's Silent control status | Active |
| Exact alarms | Allowed, confirmed in WorkPause Settings |
| Battery optimization exemption | Not enabled; unrestricted battery use recommended |
| Main screen status during readiness check | Waiting for unlock |
| Non-disruptive check | Work-profile flags unchanged before and after inspecting Settings |
| Actual pause/resume and scheduled switching | Not attempted during the assistant's readiness checks |
| Locked-device or separate work-profile credential handling | Not tested during the assistant's readiness checks |

No schedule was saved and the WorkPause switch was not changed during the readiness
check. Permission and readiness checks do **not** prove that silent switching works.
The assistant did not initiate switching, because it would interrupt work apps.
The owner's subsequent functional test report is recorded above.

There is no independent WorkPause-specific verification of Intune, Knox, employer
compliance, other work-profile credential configurations, or Samsung background restrictions.
Testing performed on the original application must not be presented as testing of WorkPause.

The single-switch UI checks were performed on the signed 1.0.2 APK. Original daily
rules and switch state were restored after testing. The README screenshot was
refreshed from this build.

The emulator had no work profile: installation, rendering, alarm cancellation, and
scheduler editing were tested, not actual profile switching. The earlier Copy command
check verified its UI response, not an independent read of Android's clipboard contents.

The 24 weekly-schedule tests cover independent daily hours, daily modes, copying,
legacy migration, validation, overnight boundaries and OFF-day priority, overlaps,
week rollover, disabled automation, and daylight-saving changes. New regressions
ensure OFF takes priority over an all-day ON rule and day edits/copying cannot
enable WorkPause. The 7 location
tests cover fix age, invalid accuracy, saved coordinates/radius, and active-window
boundaries. They do not simulate Android's location providers or enterprise management.

Release identity: `io.github.marinfrankovic.workpause`, version name `1.0.2`, version
code `3`, non-debuggable. The release certificate SHA-256 fingerprint is:

```text
b57687219a28dd705da54e5d804e1b556d5bb4ff3f43fe35b389be016bddbefe
```

Inherited Git history and old upstream tags can mention versions such as v1.4.0 or
v1.7.0. Those are not WorkPause APK versions. WorkPause uses its own application ID,
signing certificate, and release numbering.

The release title retains "Preview" and the release is marked Latest on GitHub.
Emulator and automated checks do not establish real-device
compatibility, reliable delivery of every scheduled alarm, or enterprise compliance.
